# Red Dawn Quartermaster

Open-source tool for tracking, comparing, and exporting mod lists across game servers.

## Features

- **Multi-server management** – add new servers, rename them, and assign colors.
- **Per-server mod lists** – add, edit, delete, and sort mods by name or size.
- **Local persistence** – data and theme preference are stored in `localStorage` and sync across browser tabs.
- **Theming** – toggle between light and dark modes.

## Planned Features

- Import/export mod lists.

## Hosting

The project consists of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files and can be hosted on any static file server.

## Browser Requirements

Works best in modern browsers that support JavaScript, `localStorage`, and CSS Grid (e.g., current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge).
